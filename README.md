This project was my capstone project during my MS program in Data Analytics Engineering. My group explored lineup level performance at the NBA level and used that analysis to inform what the Washington Wizards should do during this upcoming offseason. The code file included is our primary model. Also included are our final paper and presentation.

This project was completed as part of a 4-person team, but I served as project manager, wrote most of the paper, and designed and coded the model (lineupBasedModel.py).

File Descriptions:
lineupBasedModel.py -> primary model code and also includes some simple visualizations
